# Jaume Mora i Ladària

### 📚 About Me
I’m an Artificial Intelligence student at UPC Barcelona Tech with a strong interest in combining technology, creativity, and real-world impact. My academic path began in a multilingual environment through the British Council program during ESO, followed by a scientific-technological Batxillerat in Artà, Mallorca — where I first discovered my passion for programming.

Alongside my studies, I’ve gained work experience at the CanetRock festival over several summers, a role that strengthened my teamwork, communication, and problem-solving skills in high-pressure environments. I’m also a dedicated violinist, a discipline that has taught me perseverance, attention to detail, and consistency.

My goal is to grow as an AI engineer and contribute to meaningful, innovative technological projects.
