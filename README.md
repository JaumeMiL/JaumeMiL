# Jaume Mora i Ladària

### 📚 About Me
I’m an Artificial Intelligence student at UPC Barcelona Tech with hands-on experience in computer vision, applied machine learning, and software engineering. I’ve worked as a Computer Vision Intern at the UPC, where I translated and developed educational notebooks from MATLAB to Python, and as an AI Engineer at Outlier, contributing to model creation and evaluation workflows.

My background also includes several summers working at the CanetRock festival, a role that has strengthened my communication, teamwork, and problem-solving skills in fast-paced environments. As a violinist, I’ve developed discipline, attention to detail, and perseverance — qualities I apply directly to my engineering work.

I’m eager to continue growing as an AI engineer and contribute to impactful technological projects that make a real difference.
